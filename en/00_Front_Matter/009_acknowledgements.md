## Acknowledgements

David Mitchell began this project and is the principal author and editor. Many people contributed content to this book.  A comprehensive list can be derived from the git history of our project, but what follows are some specific authors and sections (apologies for any omissions):

1. Chandler, Preston [Agile at VMLY&R](/en/02_process/03_agile_at_vmlyr.md)
1. Heryer, John: [Journey Driven API Design](/en/04_techniques/08_journey_driven_api_design.md)
1. Martin, Jennifer: [Maturing the Practice](/en/04_techniques/09_maturing_the_practice.md)
1. Sykes, Jeff: [DevOps](/en/02_process/04_devops.md)

The [Pro Git book](https://github.com/progit/progit2) inspired us to use Pandoc for this.

Discovered after we started that [Daniele Dellafiore](https://medium.com/@ildella) wrote  about something similar she called [User-Journey Driven Development](https://medium.com/@ildella/i-am-about-to-start-a-new-one-day-project-and-i-am-going-to-test-a-new-process-888e3e29a76f) in August of 2015.

Thanks to [Billie Thompson (a.k.a., PurpleBooth)](https://github.com/PurpleBooth) for providing the starter contributing.md template, which we took from [Good-CONTRIBUTING.md-template.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426).
