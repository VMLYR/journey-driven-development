## Preface

We write software for clients. Our process is organic and ever-changing; created, modified, and reborn by hundreds of 5-9 person development teams over decades delivering software.

We talk about this process internally in meetings (and hallways) as well as externally at conferences. In 2019, we had the idea of naming and versioning our process. From that came the idea of open-sourcing the process. 

This book is the result. We know this book is on its own journey. We hope to continue to modify it after publication. We hope that you use and modify it as well.
