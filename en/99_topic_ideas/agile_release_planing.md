## Agile Release Planning

Answers the question: How do you estimate project costs, client pricing and delivery timelines? 
This is a favored method for coming up with an agile release plan. We have used this method successsfully on a number of projects. We adapted this approach from training by Gregory Smith of the Agile Alliance.
Once we have a story backlog, we move through a series of steps to create a release plan that maps out the stories into sprints. The plan addresses how long the project is estimated to take, and how many points per sprint the team can take on. We take the anticipated staffing and development cadence along with the timeline and derive project costs.

STEP 1: ESTABLISH THE TARGET VELOCITY

First we take the stories and lay them all out on a big table. We start with wild guess groupings. No scale or points are disclosed to the team as a basis for evaluating relativity.

The point here is to establish relativity to one another in size groupings, without indicating precision. For example, some may use a scale of sm, med, lg, xl, xxl . But we need to steer clear of qualifying a medium as “exactly twice as big as a small,” or a large is “three times a small,” etc. We seek rough sizing relative to one another. Med is simply more complex than a small, large more complex than med. To emphasize relativity and remove any precision in the scale (and have a little fun), VML favors “fruit sizing” using a planning poker deck consisting of grape, orange, coconut, pineapple, watermelon.

1.1 CALIBRATE STORIES

After assigning relative sizes to stories, the team goes through an exercise in calibration of the sizes. They group by size and look across the group for consistency. Are all grapes really grapes, or are there some oranges hiding among grapes? We perform boundary analysis — look for the biggest small and the smallest medium and evaluate that the stories are in the right size group.

1.2 EVALUATE DISTRIBUTION

Another thing we do is plot the distribution, or the number of stories in each category to evaluate the distribution of stories. Sometimes if the team lacks enough criteria to scale stories or the scale itself is not understood, a trend may arise where “everything’s an orange” which is problematic, and shows the team needs to talk more or the scale may need to be addressed. If everything were XL that would be a similar problem too.

1.3 RUN SCENARIOS OF SIZINGS IN SPRINTS 

Next the team goes through an exercise of looking at each category and estimating the number of stories per sprint (# per sprint) they can fit in. Assuming a two-week sprint, the team grabs as many smalls as they think they can fit in a sprint. Cycle through this three or four times for smalls, then move on to mediums and do the same. Repeat for the rest of the sizes and record the findings 18 (scenarios a, b, c, d).

1.4 ESTABLISH TOTAL SCOPE 

We pick a scale to assign numerical weight values to the categories. A scale based on the Fibonacci sequence is used most often (grape = 2, strawberry = 3, orange = 5, pineapple = 8, watermelon = 13). The first step toward total scope is to calculate the value per fruit category by multiplying the number of stories by the corresponding numerical weighting. Total the values across the row and this value becomes your total scope.
