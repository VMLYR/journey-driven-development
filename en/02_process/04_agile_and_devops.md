### DevOps

Our DevOps journey at VML emerged as development and operations teams searched for better ways to support the rapid pace of work in an agency.
The scripts and manual processes were neither sustainable or scalable enough to deliver as development efforts accelerated.
That effort started with destroying the silos that prevented teams from working together.
Our collaboration produced automation that enabled teams to build, unit test and deploy code rapidly with greater confidence.
As that automation matured, incremental improvements added additional testing from our Quality teams to implement stricter quality gates into application deployment pipelines.

Because DevOps is more about removing silos, we treat automation, scripts and pipelines as tools, not the product of DevOps.
We are committed to measuring, refining and improving those tools to improve our application delivery process.
We constantly ask the questions: "how might we improve this process?"
"What did we learn from this experiment?"
"Why did this failure occur?"
Asking these questions is the key to learning and continually improving.

When focusing on customer journeys, firms realize that agility and experimentation are key to unlocking value and testing insights.
In 2001, the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) articulated a new vision of software development aimed at unlocking value faster.
This value creation focused squarely on removing the barriers between business and development in order to deliver software that meets customer needs.
Traditional application delivery and deployment techniques seek to improve system stability by slowing the rate of change.
By controlling, documenting, and testing changes, organizations attempted to mitigate risk.
The competing aims of Agile and preserving system stability lead many to disillusionment with Agile.

The promise of Agile development practices is hampered or lost when following traditional application deployment and delivery techniques
Unlocking the promise of Agile and enabling the kind of experimentation necessary to learn what customers want requires increasing the rate of change not slowing changes down.

DevOps seeks to tear down the barriers between those responsible for developing and operating software.
As barriers fall, operational processes must evolve in order to deliver speed and stability simultaneously.
Efforts that do not require both speed and stability as equal goods are sure to deliver neither.

Accounts of DevOps are often told as stories.
Perhaps the most famous DevOps story to date is *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim.[^Phoenix]
This fictional account tells the tale of Bill Palmer who is elevated lead software delivery for Parts Unlimited.
Palmer is coached by a sage advisor who teaches him the Three Ways and helps him understand how lean manufacturing applies to the delivery of IT Systems.
These techniques ultimately allow him to help deliver software that allows the business to deliver software to meet customer needs.

The close history of DevOps and Agile is popularly told as Patrick DeBois was frustrated by walls of separation between application development and operations teams.[^OriginDevOps] 
In 2008, DeBois met with Andrew Schafer to discuss the topic of "Agile Infrastructure."
One of the first public expressions of what "Agile Infrastructure" or "Agile Systems Administration" might look for was presented in 2009 at the O'Reilly Velocity Conference.
John Allspaw and Paul Hammond described the process and tools they used to achieve more than ten deploys per day.[^TenPerDay]
