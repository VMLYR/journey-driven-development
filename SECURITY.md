# Security Policy

Including this for GitHub completion metrics. It's a book. I mean, we could put an exploit in the PDF, but we also distribute the build and the source so, that seems unlikely.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue, email the maintainer. Again, it's a book so don't expect you to need this.
